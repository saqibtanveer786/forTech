According to research from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.spencerstuart.com/research-and-insight/cmos-on-boards\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spencer Stuart</a>, fewer than 3% of publicly-traded Fortune 1000 boards include an active marketing leader.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The percentage is probably even lower for Series A companies whose boards tend to be composed of founders and investors, most of whom come from a finance, product or operational background and have little marketing experience (a big miss in my perspective, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another post).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>When talking to data-driven board members, stick with what can be measured: marketing&rsquo;s contribution to the near-term pipeline.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, is the need for every business leader to become more data-driven. Events and digital demand-gen activities like paid social campaigns and webinars tend to be easier to track and tie back to near-term revenue when compared to brand, content and corporate marketing.</p>\r\n",
